# Machine Learning Path
Are you planning to enhance yourself into the field of machine learning. Then this article will help you to some extent. In this article I will be adding my understanding towards how can we start our journey to be a Machine Learning Engineer.

##### What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
##### How can I learn Machine Learning by myself
In the market there are many online and offline tutorial where they will teach you Machine Learning with hefty fees. Few of them are useful to groom you as a better machine learning engineer. 
If you have enough money and time, there are many online and offline resources available I am not going to explore them here. Everyone else continue reading this article this only my perspective of learning no offensive comments. If you have any concerns that I am misguiding feel free to correct me. I am not Arthur Samuel, I will break learning into two different categories.

To start your journey with machine learning you need to choose one language. This is common for both the categories.

 - Python
 - R-language
 You can also you JAVA, .NET, C++ etc., above mentioned are most widely used in this stream. You also need to have knowledge in mathematics.

##### Getting started:
Here we don't know what ML is and why do we need to use it how do we need to use them. So, instead of eating whole elephant at once I would like to serve you in pieces. In machine learning we will be using different statistics and probability algorithms to train data. There are different libraries in Python and R, in this phase we will learn to train data using different algorithms using libraries provided in the language of your choice. **I am not branding for below mentioned URL's**, I felt reading them is a quick way to get started. I do encourage suggestions.

 - [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/): To learn machine learning algorithms with a library available in Python/ R. This tutorial will teach you in both the languages, go ahead with language of your choice.
 - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): I remember a old saying ***practice makes a man perfect*** here you can practice what you learned there are different data sets available. They will organize competitions you attend them.
 - [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/): This is one more site where you find different competitions and articles form different people who are enthusiasts to share their knowledge.

##### Advance your skills
You can improve your skills by practicing.
