# Machine Learning Path
Are you planning to enhance yourself into the field of machine learning. Then this article will help you to some extent. In this article I will be adding my understanding towards how can we start our journey to be a Machine Learning Engineer.

##### What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
##### How can I learn Machine Learning by myself
In the market there are many online and offline tutorial where they will teach you Machine Learning with hefty fees. Few of them are useful to groom you as a better machine learning engineer. 
If you have enough money and time, there are many online and offline resources available I am not going to explore them here. Everyone else continue reading this article this only my perspective of learning no offensive comments. If you have any concerns that I am misguiding feel free to correct me. I am not Arthur Samuel, I will break learning into two different categories.

To start your journey with machine learning you need to choose one language. This is common for both the categories.

 - Python
 - R-language
 You can also you JAVA, .NET, C++ etc., above mentioned are most widely used in this stream. You also need to have knowledge in mathematics.

##### Getting started:
Here we don't know what ML is and why do we need to use it how do we need to use them. So, instead of eating whole elephant at once I would like to serve you in pieces. In machine learning we will be using different statistics and probability algorithms to train data. There are different libraries in Python and R, in this phase we will learn to train data using different algorithms using libraries provided in the language of your choice. **I am not branding for below mentioned URL's**, I felt reading them is a quick way to get started. I do encourage suggestions.

 - [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/): To learn machine learning algorithms with a library available in Python/ R. This tutorial will teach you in both the languages, go ahead with language of your choice.
 - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): I remember a old saying ***practice makes a man perfect*** here you can practice what you learned there are different data sets available. They will organize competitions you attend them.
 - [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/): This is one more site where you find different competitions and articles form different people who are enthusiasts to share their knowledge.

##### Advance your skills
Once you complete the above mentioned path. Now you know what machine learning will do how to write machine learning applications. But you are not a complete machine learning engineer. So far you learned how use appropriate ML algorithm and predict based on the available data. But to know what exactly happening in the libraries we need to understand more. I will share my understanding where and what do we need to cover to make below, I have categorized based on topics mostly from NPTEL (provides E-learning through online Web and Video _courses_ again I am not branding for this site. I found it useful) .
#### Mathematics
- [Linear Algebra](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111/107/111107106/): Here you will learn linear algebra concepts.
- [Probability & Statistics](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/111/106/111106112/): Here start learning concepts of probability and statistics.
- [Basic Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AptQ4rfg79c&list=PL62urGZoWoiQBb2VjW7zsgmAbpuUnjCmt): Learn basic calculus 
These topics will help you understand machine learning algorithms.
